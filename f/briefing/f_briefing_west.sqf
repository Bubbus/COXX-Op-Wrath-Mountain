// SIDE: WEST

// ====================================================================================

//Creating simple tasks.
//Previous examples for task creation were needlessly complicated, they don't need to be. Whilst the completion of one is handled by 
//triggers in game, it can sometimes be enough to just have them be present on a players journal, it directs them, and keeps players on task.

//It is good practice to create them in the sides briefing file, as this means it seperates them neatly, without the creation of further files.

//Tasks follow this style:

//[civilian,["task1"],["Do this and you get a cookie","Earn Cookie","cookiemarker"],[0,0,0],1,2,true] call BIS_fnc_taskCreate
//[west,["task2"],["Good luck finding this cookie","Find Cookie","cookiemarker2"],objNull,1,3,true] call BIS_fnc_taskCreate //Task without a map location

//However, we don't use the civilian or west terms, as this is the western briefing file, instead, we can do something like this:

//[group player, "AANorth", ["Destroy the AA present in Northern Aliabad", "Destroy the AA", "AANorth"], "AANorth", true] call BIS_fnc_taskCreate;
//[group player, "AASouth", ["Destroy the AA present in Southern Aliabad", "Destroy the AA", "AASouth"], "AASouth", true] call BIS_fnc_taskCreate;

//The two above would create two tasks for the Blufor team, it would create tasks for any player who also has this file directed at them, this is why 
//it is better to handle tasks in the side's relevant briefing file. For the completion of tasks, refer to the trigger present on the framework's mission.sqm 
//in game.

The people of Tembelan seek freedom! For too long, their island has been sold piecemeal to the highest bidder by its leadership, its beauty and resources stripped bare by foreigners, its people exploited to tear their own island to shreds.
<br/>
But no more! The People's Liberation, Order and Progress movement needs YOU! We will storm their mountain - OUR mountain - which they use to control our roads and WE will rain fire and fury down upon their precious industry!
<br/>
Join PLOP today, and take back our island! For liberty! For freedom! For PLOP!
